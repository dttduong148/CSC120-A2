What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
All of the functions are working as expected.
One advice I would give to anyone working on this assignment in the future is to take a close look at main.py and running it several times to understand what the assignment is about before jumping into writing the code. You can get a lot more hint on what to do next and how to do it.
